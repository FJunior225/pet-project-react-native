She was found trapped inside of a tire by a Good Samaritan, when she just was 4 months old, and was brought to Bideawee for housing and care. We took one look at her, and swept her right under our wing! Pumpkin is a social and excitable Domestic shorthair kitty. She has a great deal of playful, kitten-like energy still! Pumpkin would be pleased as punch to chase a string around for hours. She is quite the socialite, too, and loves to strut around; she believes that the world is her playground! Pumpkin is quite unique in both personality and creation; she is not only zesty, but she is an uncommon find, as orange female cats are a rarity! She is seeking an equally special home to call her own. Pumpkin tends to become worked up when she receives more attention at one time than she can handle, and so she would do best in an adult home with cat-savvy adopters. All Pumpkin needs is a chance with the right family!

He is also somewhat of a country boy and still getting used to his city digs; you know walking near traffic and a lot more loud noise can be kind of scary at first.  Linus is acclimating and more and more comfortable with each day.  \n\nWith his insatiable love of blankets, Linus is aptly named :o).   He has been known to use a blanket for hide and seek, when heâs a super hero or just to carry around.  While in his foster home Linus did great with his canine foster brothers/sisters but was a little pickier when it came to his feline siblings and Linus will probably do best and be happiest in a home without cats.\n\nLinus has learned his basic manners, like âsitâ and âwaitâ when approaching a door or gate and did well when left in his crate. He is sometimes slightly shy when meeting new people, but pick up a ball or toy and Linus quickly makes friends since he LOVES to play!\n\nLinusâ estimated birth date is September 2014\n\nPlease see our homepage for visiting hours and adoption details. \n\n\nAll of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\nYou must complete an application at the shelter prior to meeting any of our animals. (Sorry--our application is not available on-line or via email.)\nWe do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\nWe require a fenced yard (sorry--no invisible fences) for homes with children under age 11.\nWe do request vet and personal references.\nAt this time, we are only able to consider applicants within 150 miles of Cincinnati.\n\n\nCanât adopt but want to help? You can make a difference! Our shelter is run entirely on volunteer-power and generous donations from animal-lovers like you. 100% of your contribution goes directly to caring for our 500+ furry residents.

Damian is living with two other dogs in his foster home and enjoys playtime. He is laid back and easily respects boundaries. Damian is also currently living with a cat! Damian enjoys car rides and is very well behaved in the car. \n\nDamian has been hard at work on his basic obedience skills and is very treat motivated!

She is about 8 years old, spayed and healthy. She came to us from a loving owner who was older and had to surrender some of her cats at the will of her landlord.  \n\n  Weâre not sure how Shorty feels around dogs because her previous owner didnât have a dog and she has minimal interaction with her foster momâs dog, but doesnât seem to care when dogs are around so we feel she would be fine in a home with respectful dogs.  \n\n  Short's adoption fee is $50 \n\n\n\n  Thank you for your interest in adopting from HMF.

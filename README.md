# Next Best Friend (React Native Front End)

OVER 7.5 MILLION DOGS AND CATS ENTER SHELTERS NATIONWIDE EVERY YEAR. OF THESE, APPROXIMATELY 30-40% ARE EUTHANIZED.

We built Next Best Friend in April 2016 to better connect these pets with potential new owners.

Next Best Friend is a React Native app with a Ruby on Rails backend API. The app incorporates a "Tinder swipe" functionality and links into the Google Maps and PetFinder APIs. Users can "favorite" animals they'd like to look at later, set their preferred location, filter by animal type, call or email the organization linked to each animal, and see a map of nearby animal shelters.
